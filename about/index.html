			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born in beautiful Tacoma, Washington, where I lived until moving to <a href="https://www.cmc.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a> in Southern California. In 2019 I graduated from CMC with a major in physics. Adam Landsberg was my undergraduate advisor. Now I'm working towards my PhD in <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/">Computer Science at CU Boulder</a> conducting science-of-science research in a lab under two advisors: <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/clauset/">Aaron Clauset</a> and <a href="https://larremorelab.github.io/">Dan Larremore</a>. My boyfriend and I live in downtown Boulder where there is a lot to see and do. In my free time I like to run, <a href="https://youtu.be/7HsBnRThsd4" target="_blank">snowkite</a>, make <a href="/pottery"> pottery</a>, and create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGngIt_khA0">interactive art projects</a> with Arduinos.</p>
