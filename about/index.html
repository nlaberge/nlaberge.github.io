			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born in beautiful Tacoma, Washington, where I lived until moving to <li><a href="www.cmc.edu">Claremont McKenna College</a></li> in Southern California. In 2019 I graduated from CMC with a major in physics. Adam Landsberg was my undergraduate advisor. Now I'm working towards my PhD in computer science at CU Boulder studying complex systems in a lab under two advisors: Aaron Clauset and Dan Larremore. My boyfriend and I live in downtown Boulder where there is a lot to see and do. In my free time I like to ride my bike, run, climb rocks, ski, and create art.</p>
